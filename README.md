# Convex-Optimization

The repository gives a Newton Method implementation for the following function:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f%28x%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Dx%5ETx%20&plus;%20log%28%20%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7Bm%7Dexp%28a%5ET_i%20x%20&plus;%20b_i%29%29)

For more details about the problem it solves, see the question [here](https://github.com/kgarg8/Convex-Optimization/blob/master/Question.png).

This was one of the homework problems for UIC ECE 594 - Convex Optimization course.
